# Using MNIST dataset create a model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

In this project, I built a complete neural network using Numpy. I implemented all the steps required to build a network 
- feedforward, 
- loss computation, 
- backpropagation, 
- weight updates etc.



 

I used the MNIST dataset to train my model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.



The assignment is divided into the following sections:

- Data preparation
- Feedforward
- Loss computation
- Backpropagation
- Parameter updates
- Model training and predictions
